#### Hi, I am a Fullstack Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience. I started my career with JavaScript and later I have worked professionally with PHP, Python, JavaScript, Jquery, Django, Laravel, Mysql, React, and VueJS. Currently, I am a Web Developer in Medigene IT, working with Laravel + VueJs. I always want to work in a challenging and dynamic work environment that provides me with generous opportunities for learning. To pursue my carrier with honesty, dignity, and punctuality; where a sense of responsibility and commitment is required.
